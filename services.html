        <h4>Services Page</h4>
        <p>St Daniel Comboni Hospital Kyamuhunga offers a number of services which include;</p>
        <h5>Out Patient Services</h5>
        The following are some of the services offered at OPD
        <ul>
          <li>Medical and Surgical consultations</li> 
          <li>Young child clinic (Immunizations, growth monitoring diagnosis and treatment of pediatric conditions)</li>
          <li>Maternal Child Health (Antenatal care, PMTCT, Postnatal Care)</li>
          <li>Primary Dental care clinic</li>
          <li>HIV/AIDS clinic (Voluntary Counseling and testing, psychosocial support, treatment and care of people living with HIV/AID</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>General Ward Services</h4>
        <p>This includes Medical Ward, Surgical Ward and it admits critical ill patients, some come during OPD working hours and are admitted through OPD while others who come after 05:00pm are admitted directly on wards. Each ward is attached to a medical doctor and headed by a ward manager/ In-charge. </p>
       


        <h4>Dental Care Services</h4>
        <p>
          Beautiful, natural teeth are everyone’s desire. Obviously, white teeth give you additional 
          self-confidence and a great smile. For complete mouth care, visit the Dental Clinic.
          The Hospital provides a limited number of dental services. Although Dental Care is one of the components 
          of Primary Health Care, its service demand is still low from the catchment population. For this reason, 
          employment of a dentist/oral surgeon is one of the least priorities of the hospital. The senior human resource 
          in this department is a Dental Assistant, with a certificate in dental care.
        </p>


        <h4>Paediatric Ward Service</h4>
        <p>
          We have a dedicated children’s ward with a large indoor and outdoor play area as well as 
          a training room. The medical and nursing team work round the clock to provide the best of 
          care to the children admitted through OPD or directly. The most common conditions are Malaria and 
          respiratory tract infections. Children who are sick enough to require intensive care will be established 
          and transferred out by the ward doctor to the nearest children’s intensive care unit for better management.
        </p>


        <h4>Imaging Services</h4>
        <p>
          The hospital has an ultramodern Radiology and Imaging Department equipped with the state of the art imaging modalities and is managed by a qualified and dedicated team. The X-Ray department is responsible for the administration and provision of x-ray diagnostic and therapeutic services. The hospital also does routine ultrasound scan examinations mostly for pregnant mothers.
        </p>

        <p>The Hospital was accredited as a distribution Centre for Anti-Retroviral drugs by Ministry of Health Uganda since May 2005. The Hospital has been providing care to people living with HIV/AIDS through the ART clinic and currently the clinic has well trained personnel in line of care and treatment. Following installment of a CD-4 count machine, the eligibility criteria developed by WHO was adopted and after a sensitization campaign of public and local leaders; the ARV Clinic began to work since the 24th May 2005. Ever since the opening of the ARV Clinic, the work has increased progressively. By 30th June 2011, a cumulative number of 3,154 patient visits have been recorded in the Clinic.</p>


        <h4>Maternity Ward services</h4>
        <p>Our maternity department is renowned for its good performance in Obstetrics and Gynecology, Maternity Care, Neonatal Care, Elective and Emergency Cesarean section. The primary concern of the department is to exceed patients’ expectations and make their stay as comfortable as possible. Maternal child health is one of our quality indicator though the reproductive health indicators are not yet among the best in the region. This is attributed to the fact that quite few mothers seek medical attention and most of the society is still conservative to traditional medicine and birth attendants. </p>

      
        <h4>Laboratory</h4>
        <p>

      </p>



      <h4>Community Health Services</h4>
      <p>
        The health system in Uganda has undergone a number of changes since independence in 1962 and the Primairy Health Care (PHC) concept was a timely innovation, and very welcome in Uganda. And also as a response to the global economic decline of the 1970s and 1980s, the World Bank and IMF introduced Structural Adjustment Programmes (SAPs) in some developing countries and accordingly a package of reforms was proposed to address problems in the health sector, and these were called health sector reforms (HSR). Both PHC and HSR have faced similar and dissimilar challenges.
 Clinical services offered include treatment of common ailments within outpatient and inpatient settings with maternity services (ANC, conducting normal deliveries, identification and referral of complicated cases to the Hospital). Among the preventive services offered are immunization, routine health education in the Health Centers and the nearby communities including schools, Voluntary Counselling and Testing (VCT) for HIV/AIDS is provided during outreach programs.

 The hospital being Health Sub-District for Igara West, on routine and emergency basis, provide support and supervision. Routine support supervision occurs once in a month for each Health Centre, while emergency supervision is carried out whenever needed. The Health Centers are fully incorporated into the district health system.
