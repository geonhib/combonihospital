          Beautiful, natural teeth are everyone’s desire. Obviously, white teeth give you additional

          For complete mouth care, visit the Dental Clinic. The Hospital provides a limited number of dental services. 
          Although Dental Care is one of the 
          components of Primary Health Care, its service demand is still low from the catchment population. <br>
          For this reason, employment of a dentist/oral surgeon is one of the least priorities of the hospital. The senior human resource in this department is a Dental Assistant, with a certificate in dental care.

      The health system in Uganda has undergone a number of changes since independence in 1962 and the 
      Primairy Health Care (PHC) concept was a timely innovation, and very welcome in Uganda. <br>
      And also as a response to the global economic decline of the 1970s and 1980s, the World Bank and IMF introduced 
      Structural Adjustment Programmes (SAPs) in some developing countries and accordingly a package of reforms was 
      proposed to address problems in the health sector, and these were called health sector reforms (HSR). <br>
      Both PHC and HSR have faced similar and dissimilar challenges.
      Clinical services offered include treatment of common ailments within outpatient and inpatient settings 
      with maternity services (ANC, conducting normal deliveries, identification and referral of complicated cases to 
      the Hospital). Among the preventive services offered are immunization, routine health education in the Health 
      Centers and the nearby communities including schools, Voluntary Counselling and Testing (VCT) for HIV/AIDS is 
      provided during outreach programs. <br>
      The hospital being Health Sub-District for Igara West, on routine and emergency basis, provide support and 
      supervision. Routine support supervision occurs once in a month for each Health Centre, while emergency 
      supervision is carried out whenever needed. The Health Centers are fully incorporated into the district health system.
